# MakingTeXWork

## tohle jsem si naklonoval z public source dokumentu o TeXu -- až budu mít chuť

This repository contains a snapshot of the sources for
*Making TeX Work*, a book I wrote in the 1990's.

I'm sure the TeX doesn't build anymore.

I'm also sure that the XML conversion is incomplete.

I once dreamed that I'd do more work on this, but that seems
unlikely now.

For posterity!
