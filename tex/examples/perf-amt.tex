\head{1.1} Odd Perfect Numbers\endhead

A number is said to be {\it perfect\/} if it
is the sum of its divisors.  For example, $6$ is
perfect because $1+2+3 = 6$, and $1$, $2$, and $3$
are the only numbers that divide evenly into $6$ 
(apart from $6$ itself).

It has been shown that all even perfect numbers
have the form $$2^{p-1}(2^{p}-1)$$ where $p$
and $2^{p}-1$ are both prime.

The existence of {\it odd\/} perfect numbers is 
an open question.
