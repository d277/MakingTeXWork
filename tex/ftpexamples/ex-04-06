@section Odd Perfect Numbers

A number is said to be @i{perfect} if it is
the sum of its divisors.  For example, 6 is 
perfect because
@tex $1+2+3 = 6$,
@end tex
@ifinfo
1+2+3 = 6,
@end ifinfo
and 1, 2, and 3 are the only numbers that divide 
evenly into 6 (apart from 6 itself).

It has been shown that all even perfect numbers
have the form 
@tex $$2^{p-1}(2^{p}-1)$$ where $p$ and $2^{p}-1$
@end tex
@ifinfo
@center 2^(p-1) (2^p - 1)

where p and 2^p - 1
@end ifinfo
are both prime.

The existence of @i{odd} perfect numbers is an
open question.
