There are three macros for indexing:

  \idx{word or phrase}  inserts "word or phrase" into the text
                        and the index.

  \ixx{word or phrase}{index entry}  inserts "word or phrase" into the
                                     text and "index entry" into the index.

  \index{index entry}   inserts "index entry" into the index.




If you use \index, make sure it touches the word you're indexing:

  e.g. this is how to index fred\index{fred's entry} if you need to.




Multiple levels of indexing are seperated by exclamation points:

  
  "Fonts!PostScript!AFM Files"  creates the index   Fonts
                                                      PostScript
						         AFM Files   999


To index a range of pages, put

  "index entry|("  at the beginning, and
  "index entry|)"  at the end.
