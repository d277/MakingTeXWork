      A number is said to be {\itfont perfect\/} if it
      is the sum of its divisors.  For example, 6 is
      perfect because $1+2+3 = 6$, and 1, 2, and 3
      are the only numbers that divide evenly into 6 
      (apart from 6 itself).

      \vskip\baselineskip
      It has been shown that all even perfect numbers
      have the form $$2^{p-1}(2^{p}-1)$$ where $p$
      and $2^{p}-1$ are both prime.

      \vskip\baselineskip
      The existence of {\itfont odd\/} perfect numbers is 
      an open question.
