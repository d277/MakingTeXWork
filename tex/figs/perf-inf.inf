Odd Perfect Numbers
===================

A number is said to be perfect if it is the sum
of its divisors.  For example, 6 is perfect
because 1+2+3 = 6, and 1, 2, and 3 are the only
numbers that divide evenly into 6 (apart from 6
itself).

It has been shown that all even perfect numbers
have the form

                2^(p-1) (2^p - 1)

where p and 2^p - 1 are both prime.

The existence of odd perfect numbers is an open
question.
