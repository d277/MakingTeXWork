These are the complete (I believe) sources for _Making TeX Work_

_Making TeX Work_ was last published in 1994 using LaTeX 2.09.

I have not, and probably never will, update these files to use
LaTeX2e, so they are effectively unTeXable at this point.

They are provided so that readers can peruse the source for ideas
and examples.

If you're interested in a more publishable, readable version,
