<para>The animal featured on the cover of <citetitle>Making TeX
Work</citetitle> is the European garden spider. Garden spiders are orb
weavers, known for their intricate orb-shaped webs. Web building is a
complex process: support lines are constructed first; then the radial
lines; and finally the spiraling strands are spun from the center
outward. Without training from adults, even the tiniest just-hatched
spiderlings are able to spin silk and weave webs. Another orb weaver,
<emphasis>nephila</emphasis>, builds an extremely thick and strong
web, up to eight feet in diameter. People in Southeast Asia have found
an interesting use for this spider's web&mdash;they bend a pliable
stick into a loop and pass it through the large web, resulting in a
surprisingly strong and effective fishing net!</para>

<para>Spiders produce silk from glands called spinnerets. Orb weavers
can have three or four pairs of these glands, each producing different
textures of silk: non-stick silk for the radial web lines, and sticky
silk for the spiraling strands. Some spiders even produce an
ultraviolet silk to attract insects. Spider silk, a super protein that
hardens as it is stretched from the spinnerets, may look delicate but
it is unbelievably tough. The relative tension necessary to break it
is far greater than for steel.</para>

<para>When finished with the construction of its web, the garden
spider will often go to the center, hang upside down, and wait for a
flying or jumping insect to become ensnared. Having poor eyesight, orb
weavers rely on a highly-developed sense of touch. When an insect
because caught in th web and struggles, the spider is alerted by the
vibrations. It rushes tout to secure its prey, usually wrapping it in
silk. A poison is injected into the victim, paralyzing it and
converting the contents of its body to a liquid. The spider returns
later to insert its tube-like fangs and suck up its meal.</para>

<para>The garden spider's profound sense of touch has another purpose:
it provides male spiders with a channel to communicate with females.
Before climbing onto the female's web, the male taps out a special
message. Then he cautiously crawls toward his mate&mdash;a perilous
task, for he is always in danger of being mistaken for prey. It is
commonly thought that the female spider kills and eats the male after
mating, but this is an exaggeration. The male, who stops eating during
his mate-hunting ordeal, generally dies of malnourishment and
exhaustion.</para>

<para>Spiders are similar to, but not the same as insects. They belong to
the class <emphasis>Arachnida</emphasis>, named after Arachne, a
maiden in Greek mythology. She defeated the goddess Athena in a
weaving contest. In a fury of anger, Athena destroyed Arachne's
weaving and beat the girl about the head. In utter disgrace, Arachne
hanged herself. A regretful Athena changed Arachne into a spider so
that she could weave forever.</para>

<para>While they are certainly not going to win any popularity
contests, spiders' insect-eating habits are extremely helpful to
humans. Every year, billions of spiders do away with a large number of
disease-carrying and crop-destroying insects. If every spider ate just
one a day for a year, those insects, piled in one spot, would weigh as
much as 50 million people. Spiders are, by far, the most important
predator of insects in our world.</para>

<para>Edie Freedman designed this cover and the entire UNIX bestiary
that appears on other Nutshell Handbooks. The beasts themselves are
adapted from nineteenth century engravings from the Dover Pictorial
Archive. The cover layout was produced with QuarkXPress 3.1 using the
ITC Garamond font.</para>

<para>The inside layout was designed by Edie Freedman and implemented
by Norm Walsh in &TeX; using the ITC Garamond font family. The figures
(except those in chapter 6) were created in Aldus Freehand 3.1 by
Chris Reilley. The colophon was written by Elaine and Michael
Kalantarian.</para>
