<title>&TeX; on the Macintosh</title>

<para><indexterm><primary>Macintosh</primary><secondary sortas="TeX implementations">&TeX; implementations</secondary></indexterm>For the 
most part, using &TeX; on the Macintosh is like using &TeX; on 
any other system.  Certainly, the &TeX; documents that you edit are
the same, and the output (on paper) is the same as the output from
any other version of &TeX;.
</para>

<para>However, because they are immersed in a
consistent graphical environment, Macintosh tools have a substantially different
appearance from their non-graphical counterparts.<footnote><para>{I'm not going
to argue about the relative merits of graphical and non-graphical
environments or particular implementations of graphical environments.
When all is said and done, the Mac <emphasis>is</emphasis> different.  At least today.}</para></footnote>
</para>

<para>There are four implementations of &TeX; available for the Macintosh.
Of these four, one is commercial, two are shareware, and one is (mostly)
free.  The following sections present an overview of each implementation,
in alphabetical order.  
</para>

<section id="sec.Excalibur"><title>CMac&TeX;</title>

<para>The &cmactex;<indexterm><primary sortas="cmactex">&cmactex;</primary></indexterm> package includes the most recent 
versions of &TeX; and
&MF; and all of the standard tools.  A port of \dvips\index{dvips!for Macintosh} is also included,
as well as a <filename role="extension">DVI</filename> previewer and a <command>PrintPS<indexterm><primary>PrintPS</primary></indexterm></command> tool for
printing PostScript files directly to a LaserWriter printer over AppleTalk.
</para>

<para>Each utility is a straightforward port of its &unix; counterpart.
Command-line options have been replaced by standard
Mac dialog boxes and menus where appropriate.  &TeX; has been extended to include a
built-in editor, although it is not necessary to use that editor if
you have another favorite.
</para>

<para>By design, &cmactex; is a very modular package.  This makes it easy to
substitute different tools, or different ports of the same tools, where
it is advantageous to do so.  For example, you can use 
<command>MacGS<indexterm><primary>MacGS</primary></indexterm></command><indexterm><primary>Ghostscript</primary><secondary>for Macintosh</secondary></indexterm> (a 
Macintosh version of <command>Ghostscript</command>) as a
previewer if you like.
</para>

<para>Small versions of &TeX;, ini&TeX;, &MF;, and <command>iniMF</command> are provided
in the free distribution of &cmactex;.  Big versions are 
available only in a commercial distribution purchased directly from the
author.  At the time of this writing, 
the commercial distribution is
available on diskettes and via email.
The commercial version also provides
fully automated font generation (see <quote><xref role="label" linkend="sec.autofont"/></quote> in
Chapter&nbsp;<xref role="label" linkend="chap.fonts"/>, <emphasis><xref role="label" linkend="chap.fonts"/></emphasis>) and faster versions of
&TeX; and &MF;.
</para>

<para>The configuration files<indexterm><primary>configuration files</primary><secondary>for Macintosh</secondary></indexterm> used 
by &cmactex; resemble the environment
variables used by implementations of &TeX; on other systems.  You can
set up multiple search folders for input files and fonts, for example,
by providing a list of folder names separated by colons.
</para>

<para>Table&nbsp;<xref role="label" linkend="tab.mac.cmacdist"/> summarizes the &cmactex; version 2.1
distribution available on the CTAN archives (in
<filename role="ctan" class="directory">systems/mac/cmactex</filename>) as of July, 1993.  The top-level folders and

<para>The installation instructions for &cmactex; are easy to understand, but
you will have to configure &cmactex; before you try to use it.  
Unfortunately, the default configuration files do not reflect the layout
of folders that results directly from unpacking the archive files.
</para>

<para>&cmactex; includes a prebuilt format file for Plain &TeX;, but if you 
want to use &LaTeX;, you will have to build the format file with ini&TeX; first.

</para>

<para>Because I don't have access to a Mac with MPW installed, there is very

<section><title>Textures</title>

<para><command>Textures<indexterm><primary>Textures</primary></indexterm></command> is a commercial implementation of &TeX; 
from Blue Sky Research<indexterm><primary>Blue Sky Research</primary></indexterm>. It has a number of features that make it unique in the
&TeX; market. It is supported by a complete 
user's guide and access to telephone and email product support.
</para>

<para>&Textures; supports an interactive preview mode called 
        <emphasis>Lightning</emphasis> &Textures;<indexterm><primary>Lightning Textures</primary></indexterm><indexterm><primary>previewing</primary><secondary>for Macintosh Textures</secondary></indexterm>.  It is 
        this feature that really sets 
        &Textures; apart
        from other implementations.  In this mode, changes to your document
        are reflected immediately in the preview window.  In an environment
        with sufficient resources (memory and processing speed), the result
        is striking.  Constructing complex items like tables and mathematical
        formulae is much easier, especially for the &TeX;         novice, than using the conventional edit, &TeX;, preview, debug
        cycle.  Because the log file is also visible, it's easy to see
        when you've written erroneous &TeX; code.
</para>

<para>        Note that <emphasis>Lightning Textures</emphasis> is not really a WYSIWYG
        environment (like <command>Scientific Word</command>, for example) because
        you still enter regular &TeX; commands in a purely textual
        fashion.  You get immediate feedback in a different window.
</para>

<para>&Textures; is fast.  Extensive instrumentation and hand-tuning
        of the program has produced an executable that is
        several (maybe many) times faster than other &TeX; executables
        on similar hardware.
</para>

<para>A complete set of Computer Modern Roman fonts is provided 
        in Adobe Type&nbsp;1 format.  This means that any font can
        be rendered at any size without loss of quality.
PostScript versions of the \AmS-fonts are also available.  The
        fonts can be purchased separately in either Macintosh or
        Adobe <filename role="extension">PFB</filename> formats.
</para>

<para>&Textures; is a very integrated environment.  This can hardly be
labelled a disadvantage considering how well it works, but it does
mean that some extra effort is required if you want access to your
document in a less integrated fashion.  Using another editor to
compose your document is possible, but it prevents you from using
<emphasis>Lighting</emphasis> &Textures;.  Starting with version 1.6, the
&Textures; editor includes a macro programming language, so you can
customize it with features that you find useful.  Blue Sky Research
provides the tools you need to incorporate other fonts into
&TeX; or extract &TeX; files (like <filename role="extension">DVI</filename> files) that are normally
hidden from view by &Textures;.
</para>

<para>Figure&nbsp;<xref role="label" linkend="fig.mac.textures"/> shows an example of a &Textures; session.  The
preview quality in this image is less than optimal because the Macintosh
that &Textures; is running on does not have Adobe Type Manager.
</para>

<para>Because the Computer Modern Roman fonts are included in Adobe Type&nbsp;1
format, &MF; is not provided in the &Textures; package.  Recently, BSR
made their version of &MF; freely available.
BSR's &MF; 
was designed to work with &Textures;, and creates output files that are
suitable for &Textures;, but not necessarily the standard <filename role="extension">GF</filename> and
<filename role="extension">TFM</filename> files you might expect.  Those files can be obtained elsewhere, of course.
</para>

<para>The &Textures; package includes implementations of many auxiliary &TeX; programs including &BibTeX;<indexterm><primary sortas="bibtex">&BibTeX;</primary></indexterm>, <command>MakeIndex<indexterm><primary>MakeIndex</primary></indexterm></command>, 
the <command>Excalibur<indexterm><primary>Excalibur</primary></indexterm></command>

this chapter), a <command>DVITool<indexterm><primary>DVITool</primary></indexterm></command>
for importing and exporting <filename role="extension">DVI</filename> files, and font tools for importing
and exporting fonts. (Because &Textures; doesn't use <filename role="extension">PK</filename> files directly,
the standard \mfware tools are not provided.)  The &Textures; font tools
are freely available from Blue Sky Research; see the <quote><xref role="label" linkend="sec.bsrtools"/></quote>
section later in this chapter.  &Textures; also supports virtual fonts.
</para>

<para>&Textures; includes the Eplain<indexterm><primary>Eplain</primary></indexterm> and Midnight<indexterm><primary>Midnight</primary></indexterm> macro
packages in addition to Plain &TeX; and &LaTeX;.  ini&TeX; is built into
&Textures;, so you can make additional format files as described in
Chapter&nbsp;<xref role="label" linkend="chap.macpack"/>, <emphasis><xref role="label" linkend="chap.macpack"/></emphasis>.  Making format files
with &Textures; requires a Macintosh Plus or other system with at least
1Mb of memory.
</para>

<para>The &Textures; previewer and printing operations understand bitmap or
scalable (EPSF) pictures inserted into your document with
<markup>\special</markup> commands.  Although not visible on the previewer, raw
PostScript can also be inserted for documents printed on PostScript
devices.
