<title>Commercial Environments</title>

<para>There are several commercial versions<indexterm><primary sortas="tex">&TeX;</primary><secondary>commercial implementations</secondary></indexterm> of &TeX; on the market.  The advantage of commercial
programs over free ones is that they provide an automated installation
procedure and some level of technical support.  There's no reason to believe
that a commercial implementation of &TeX; is necessarily better than a free
one (or vice versa, for that matter) because the source code for &TeX; is in
the public domain.
</para>

<para>The following sections highlight several commercial implementations of
&TeX;.
</para>

<section id="sec.com.turbo"><title>&utex; by ArborText</title>

<para>ArborText<indexterm><primary>ArborText</primary></indexterm> sells &utex;<indexterm><primary sortas="utex">&utex;</primary></indexterm> for MS-DOS<indexterm><primary>MS-DOS</primary><secondary sortas="TeX implementations">&TeX; implementations</secondary></indexterm> systems as well as an implementation of
&TeX; for &unix; workstations.  The ArborText previewer and &dvidriver; software are also available for both &unix; and MS-DOS systems.  The following
discussion is based on experiences with &utex; version 3.14B, the MS-DOS
implementation of ArborText's &TeX; package.
</para>

<para>The &utex; package is a complete &TeX; implementation for MS-DOS.  The
additional utilities, <command>PLtoTF</command><indexterm><primary>PLtoTF</primary></indexterm>,
<command>TFtoPL</command><indexterm><primary>TFtoPL</primary></indexterm>, and
&BibTeX;<indexterm><primary sortas="bibtex">&BibTeX;</primary></indexterm>, are also included.  Neither &MF; nor
<command>MakeIndex</command> is provided.
</para>

<para>The default installation of &utex; creates format files for Plain &TeX; and
&LaTeX;.  To be as fast as possible, &utex; creates executable
versions of &TeX; for each of these formats; these versions have the
appropriate macro packages preloaded into the executable.  You can use the
standard notation to load alternate macro packages if you wish to save disk
space.
</para>

<para>ArborText includes a lot of support for using &TeX; for non-English
documents<indexterm><primary>international</primary><secondary>support by ArborText</secondary></indexterm>.  Several files of
international hyphenation patterns (English, French<indexterm><primary>French</primary></indexterm>, German<indexterm><primary>German</primary></indexterm>,
Dutch<indexterm><primary>Dutch</primary></indexterm>, and Portuguese<indexterm><primary>language considerations</primary></indexterm>) are provided, as well as reprints of the TUGboat articles
describing new features of &TeX; version 3.0 and virtual fonts.
</para>

<para>Designed for an MS-DOS environment having only limited memory, &utex; uses a
swap file (potentially located in EMS<indexterm><primary>EMS memory</primary></indexterm> or XMS memory<indexterm><primary>XMS memory</primary></indexterm>)
to process large files.  Several environment variables can be used to alter
the size of internal &TeX; data structures when a new format is being
produced.  In terms of big and small versions, &utex; can be configured either
way.  These choices are made when you create the format file however, so you
will need to use ini&TeX;<indexterm><primary sortas="initex">ini&TeX;</primary></indexterm> (included with &utex;) to make a
<quote>bigger</quote> &TeX;.
</para>

<para>One of the most interesting features of &utex; is a quick-and-dirty preview
mode provided by the &TeX; executable.  After at least one page of your
document has been processed, you can switch to a preview mode and see what the
page looks like while &TeX; continues processing your document.  This
previewer is not particularly attractive, but it's quick and easy to use.  No
other previewer is provided.  ArborText sells a fully functional previewer as
a separate package.
</para>

<para>To print your documents, you must purchase or obtain a &dvidriver; separately.  ArborText sells two drivers, one for HP LaserJet printers and
another for PostScript printers.  The &utex; distribution includes a complete
set of <filename role="extension">TFM</filename> files, but it does not include any <filename role="extension">PK</filename> files.
</para>

<para>The ArborText previewer is summarized in the section called
<quote><xref role="label" linkend="sec.arb.preview"/></quote> in Chapter&nbsp;<xref role="label" linkend="chap.preview"/>, <emphasis><xref role="label" linkend="chap.preview"/></emphasis>.  The ArborText printer drivers,

<section><title>\yyTeX</title>

<para>\yyTeX<indexterm><primary sortas="yyTeX">\yyTeX</primary></indexterm> is an MS-DOS<indexterm><primary>MS-DOS</primary><secondary sortas="TeX implementations">&TeX; implementations</secondary></indexterm> implementation of &TeX; by &YY; Inc.<indexterm><primary sortas="YY Inc.">&YY; Inc.</primary></indexterm> 
(a 386 or higher processor is required).  \yyTeX is
sold as a bundled package with
<command>DVIWindo</command><indexterm><primary>DVIWindo</primary></indexterm>,
<command>dvipsone</command><indexterm><primary>dvipsone</primary></indexterm>,<footnote><para>{<command>DVIWindo</command>

and <command>dvipsone</command> is described in Chapter&nbsp;<xref role="label" linkend="chap.printing"/>.}</para></footnote> 
and a set of PostScript fonts (either the
Computer Modern fonts, the Lucida Bright and Lucida New Math fonts, or the
MathTime fonts).  The installation provides format files for Plain &TeX; and
&LaTeX;.
</para>

<para>\yyTeX stands out among &TeX; systems because of its memory management.
Unlike other &TeX; systems, which exist in big and small versions, all of
\yyTeX's memory management is dynamic.  All of the buffers that &TeX; uses
(main memory, font memory, string memory, etc.) will expand to meet the needs
of the most complex documents you create.  The memory required for hyphenation
patterns is dynamically allocated as well, which means that you can construct
multilingual formats with as many sets of hyphenation patterns as you need
(multilingual formats are discussed in more detail in
Chapter&nbsp;<xref role="label" linkend="chap.foreign"/>, <emphasis><xref role="label" linkend="chap.foreign"/></emphasis>).  The advantage
of dynamic memory management over a fast and big &TeX; is that \yyTeX starts
out small (big &TeX;s reserve a large fixed amount of memory even when
processing simple jobs that don't require very much).  In a multitasking
environment where several programs are competing for memory, one large program
can slow the progress of the entire system.  \yyTeX's memory manager supports
XMS<indexterm><primary>XMS memory</primary></indexterm>, VCPI<indexterm><primary>VCPI memory</primary></indexterm>, and DPMI<indexterm><primary>DPMI memory</primary></indexterm>.
This means that it can run under MS-DOS with any of the common memory managers
and under Windows, Windows NT, and DOS sessions in OS/2<indexterm><primary>Microsoft Windows</primary><secondary sortas="TeX implementations">&TeX; implementations</secondary></indexterm><indexterm><primary>Microsoft Windows NT</primary><secondary sortas="TeX implementations">&TeX; implementations</secondary></indexterm><indexterm><primary sortas="NT TeX implementations">NT &TeX; implementations</primary></indexterm>.
</para>

<para>\yyTeX has a couple of additional strengths for multilingual use: it supports
customizable input character translation and more than 255 internal font
numbers. Most versions of &TeX; only support a maximum of 255 fonts in any
single document.

<para>At the time of this writing, a new version of Turbo&TeX; is actively being
developed.  Unfortunately, it was not available for review in time for this
edition of <emphasis>Making &TeX; Work</emphasis>.  The Kinch Computer Company claims that
the next release will include a big &TeX; running under Windows 3.1/Win32s and
Windows NT as a native, protected-mode 32-bit application.  A new Windows
previewer will also be available, and it takes advantage of Windows <quote>multiple
document interface</quote> to preview multiple documents in the same session.  Kinch
will also provide a set of the standard Computer Modern Fonts in TrueType and
Type 1 formats.

TCI Software Research<indexterm><primary>TCI Software Research</primary></indexterm>, bridges the gap between &TeX; and word processing
by providing a more or less WYSIWYG interface on top of &TeX;.
<command>Scientific Word</command> requires Microsoft 
Windows<indexterm><primary>Microsoft Windows</primary><secondary sortas="TeX implementations">&TeX; implementations</secondary></indexterm>.
Figure&nbsp;<xref role="label" linkend="fig.sciword"/> shows a sample document being edited by
<command>Scientific Word</command>.
</para>

<figure id="fig.sciword">
<title>Editing a document with <application>Scientific Word</application>
</title>
<screen>FIXME:</screen>
</figure>

<para><command>Scientific Word</command> is a powerful program that might prove to
be invaluable in some circumstances.  An ideal candidate for 
<command>Scientific Word</command> is someone with little or no desire to learn
&TeX;, but who wants professional quality output for documents
containing a lot of mathematics.  <command>Scientific Word</command> is not simply
a fast, interactive previewer; it really is a visual editor that
produces &TeX; code behind the scenes.  You enter document elements
(even complex elements like mathematics) in an interactive push-button
fashion, and <command>Scientific Word</command> translates it into the appropriate
&LaTeX; input.
This is very different
from Blue Sky Research's <command>Textures</command> where the user types in 
&TeX; but has nearly instantaneous feedback.
</para>

<para>Unfortunately, the complexity of &TeX; vastly exceeds
<command>Scientific Word's</command> ability to act as a visual editor, and this
leads to a number of potentially confusing discrepancies.  For
example, in a &TeX; document, the <markup>\parindent</markup> and
<markup>\parskip</markup> control sequences control the indentation of the
first line of a paragraph and the distance between paragraphs.  In
<command>Scientific Word</command>, the on-screen appearance of the document is
controlled separately.  This difference is apparent in
Figure&nbsp;<xref role="label" linkend="fig.sciword"/>, where the paragraphs appear to be indented with
no additional space between them, and Figure&nbsp;<xref role="label" linkend="fig.commercial.swpreview"/>
(the same document shown in the previewer) where the paragraphs are not
indented but have additional space between them.
</para>

<para>These discrepancies arise because <command>Scientific Word</command> was designed with
the same philosophy as &LaTeX;: separation of content and form.  The purpose of
the <command>Scientific Word</command> editor is to allow you to organize your thoughts
and perfect the content of your document.  It is the job of &LaTeX;, in
conjunction with the document style options that you select, to perfect the
appearance of your document.  The display shown in Figure&nbsp;<xref role="label" linkend="fig.sciword"/> is
not incorrect in any way, it just isn't WYSIWYG.  TCI Research claims that
<quote>by going beyond WYSIWYG, <command>Scientific Word</command> allows you to focus on
the creative process&nbsp;$&hellip;$ and not the layout commands necessary to typeset
[your document].</quote>
</para>

<figure id="fig.commercial.swpreview">
<title>Preview of the Scientific Word document shown in
Figure <xref linkend="fig.sciword"/></title>
<screen>FIXME:</screen>
</figure>

<para>When <command>Scientific Word</command> encounters &TeX; code that it does not
understand, it leaves a labelled grey box in the display (you can see two such
boxes above the chapter title <quote>Unsolved Problems</quote> in
Figure&nbsp;<xref role="label" linkend="fig.sciword"/>).<footnote><para>{I forced the issue of unrecognized control
sequences by inserting \parskip and \parindent control sequences into
the body of the document.  They really belong in a document style option.}</para></footnote>
This means that you can edit all of the &TeX; code in your document from
within <command>Scientific Word</command>, and small amounts of customization do not
require abandoning the program.  The <command>Scientific Word</command> technical
reference, included online with the program, describes how you can tailor
<command>Scientific Word</command> to recognize many of your customizations.
</para>

<para>Behind the scenes, <command>Scientific Word</command> documents are processed by
a full-fledged &TeX; processor (&TurboTeX;<indexterm><primary sortas="TurboTeX">&TurboTeX;</primary></indexterm> by the
Kinch Computer Company<indexterm><primary>Kinch Computer Company</primary></indexterm>).
This includes integrated document formatting and previewing under Windows.
Starting with version 1.1 of <command>Scientific Word</command>, instructions are
included to switch to a different version of &TeX;, or different previewers
and &dvidriver;s, if you prefer.
